# Smoke-Detection-IoT
Fires are always alarming, even terrifying. They kill people and ruin families with their destruction. It is critical that we enhance fire safety awareness and use firefighting equipment intelligently to minimize losses and damages. Smoke detectors are automated sentries, able to detect smoke in real time. If the density of smoke exceeds a predetermined threshold, a smart smoke detector will send information to the backend management platform and activate related devices such as alarm bells. The platform will then automatically send the information to the corresponding departments and alert the right personnel by voice messages or SMS.  However, traditional standalone smoke detectors cannot meet the requirements of smart firefighting. They report false alarms and cannot interact with people like the property owners, security guards, or fire fighters. Distributed installation is difficult and expensive. Power-hungry traditional smoke detectors require frequent battery replacements and are more expensive to maintain.
